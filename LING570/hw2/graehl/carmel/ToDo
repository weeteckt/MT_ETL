features:
training with conditional normalization - option to leave alone or assign uniform weights to arcs with zero counts for some input leaving some state (but often people like zeroing out unused arcs for pruning?)
attach and preserve arbitrary labels to arcs (states already have their arbitrary names)
'wildcard', 'except-state' and 'except-global' label for arcs - for input or output not seen leaving the state, or at all
external input/output dictionary files?  binary format?
option to iteratively sum paths with e-cycles for -S and -t.  use matrix math (e-paths of length 0,1,2,3... = 1+A^1+A^2+ ...)

code:
List::count_length for input sequences - use iterators instead?
unnecessary copying of path lists due to lameness of output iterator / insert_iterator
STL allocator - get rid of CUSTOMNEW mess (is it faster?)
command-line regression tests
unit tests
STL hash
one filename per public class: Class.h Class.cc
