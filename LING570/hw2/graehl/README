tt: tree transducer toolkit (and derivation forests EM training)

carmel: finite state transducer toolkit (and k-best graph paths)
 (see carmel/README)

shared: generic routines used by both

Make sure the environment variable ARCH is set to something
(cygwin,linux,solaris)

Requires GNU make (unfortunately, version 3.80 or greater is required due to
some bugs with earlier versions' $(eval)), and a modern standards-complaint C++
compiler (gcc 3.4 is known good, as is Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1)

Also requires Boost (http://boost.org) in your standard include directory (you
can just use the boost directory in this distribution) - set
BOOST_DIR=/path/to/boost if you have located your Boost elsewhere.

cd carmel
ARCH=linux 
export ARCH
make

ARCH can be whatever you like - it's not used for anything except to keep object
files and binaries segregated.  (exception: if you build with ARCH=macosx, no
static binaries will be built, since the platform doesn't seem to support it).
